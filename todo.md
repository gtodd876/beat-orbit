# Beat Orbit - Game Jam Todo List

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Overview
Beat Orbit is a rhythm game where players time button presses as a single arrow rotates around a drum wheel. The game starts directly on the main gameplay screen. Players progress through rounds (Kick â†’ Snare â†’ Hi-Hat), with hit targets appearing on specific beats for each round. The pattern grid at the bottom controls drum sample playback and shows recorded hits.
