# Beat Orbit - Game Jam Todo List

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Overview
Beat Orbit is a rhythm game where players time button presses as a single arrow rotates around a drum wheel. The game starts directly on the main gameplay screen. Players progress through rounds (Kick â†’ Snare â†’ Hi-Hat), with hit targets appearing on specific beats for each round. The pattern grid at the bottom controls drum sample playback and shows recorded hits.

## Current Implementation Status âœ…
- âœ… Core gameplay loop working
- âœ… Single rotating arrow mechanic
- âœ… Layer-based progression (Kick â†’ Snare â†’ Hi-Hat)
- âœ… Wild animations on successful hits (kick spins, snare reverses, hihat changes direction)
- âœ… Pattern grid visualization with beat tracking
- âœ… Basic scoring and combo system
- âœ… Audio samples integrated (3 velocity layers per drum)
- âœ… Input system (SPACE to hit, ESC to pause, R to restart)
- âœ… Pattern grid controls playback
- âœ… Current beat indicator ("B" marker) in pattern grid
- âœ… Hit targets appear/disappear when successfully hit
- âœ… Completion messages for layers and patterns
- âœ… Beat detection properly aligned (1 at 12 o'clock, etc.)
- âœ… Music integration with BPM sync (Level 1 complete)
- âœ… Visual miss feedback (magenta line shows where arrow was pointing)
- âœ… Dialog positioning (level complete left, layer complete right)
- âœ… 4-second delay before "Press SPACE for next level"
- âœ… Pattern grid drum samples stay synced to music BPM
