# TODO - Day 1 (Beat Orbit Development)

## ðŸŽ¯ Morning Session (2-3 hours)
**Goal: Get the core game loop working**

### 1. Complete Scene Setup (30 min)

  - [ ] Beat counter
- [ ] Add pause functionality
- [ ] Create minimal main menu (just Start button)

### 4. First Playable Build (45 min)
- [ ] Test complete game flow: menu â†’ game â†’ win â†’ next level
- [ ] Export to HTML5
- [ ] Test in browser locally
- [ ] Upload to itch.io as private/draft

## ðŸŒ† Evening Session (2-3 hours) 
**Goal: Polish and visual style**

### 1. Create Visual Assets (1 hour)
- [ ] Create in Affinity Designer/Inkscape:

## ðŸ“‹ If Time Permits
- [ ] Add tutorial/instruction screen
- [ ] Create additional levels
- [ ] Implement high score saving
- [ ] Add more drum types (crash, toms)
- [ ] Create background music

## ðŸš« Do NOT Do Today
- Complicated visual effects
- Perfect art (placeholder is fine)
- Feature creep
- Multiplayer/leaderboards
- Complex animation systems

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Wins If Stuck
- Use Godot's built-in shapes for visuals
- Use simple colors instead of textures
- Focus on one perfect level rather than many rough ones
- Use text labels if UI is taking too long

## ðŸŽ® End of Day Goal
**A playable game with:**
- Working core mechanic
- 3-4 levels
- Basic visual style
- Uploaded to itch.io (even if private)

Remember: Game feel > features. A simple game that feels great is better than a complex game that feels rough!
